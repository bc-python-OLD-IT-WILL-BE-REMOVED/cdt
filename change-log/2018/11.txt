**Serious new build of the brand new ¨cdt:** this project is a total refactoring of tools to write a pedagogical log which are called "[c]ahier [d]e [t]exte" in french. The aim of this version is to be used by other teachers than the author of ¨cdt.


**Making of a TUI:** merely empty shells has been implemented to allow to work with ¨cdt inside a terminal.


**Specifications:** we start to code an easy-to-maintain factory containing only at this time the following specifications: months, tests and tables of content for one class.
