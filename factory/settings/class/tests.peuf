    In this file you can indicate efficiently all your tests. For the moment
    there are 7 kinds of tests.

       1) ``computer``: an evaluation with the use of a computer.

       2) ``home``: a homework evaluated.

       3) ``lesson``: a test evaluating a good knowledge of the lesson.

       4) ``mcq``: a multi-choice questions like test.

       3) ``oral``: an oral evaluation.

       6) ``presentation``: a presentation evaluated.

       7) ``test``: a classical test.


    Let's see for example how to indicate one classical test using all the
    informations (the same features are available for all kinds of tests).


    Here is an example code : see inside the two horizontal rules.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    test\::
        date    = 24/10/2018  (2018-10-14)
        toc     = A...B-I-1 & C-I
        time    = 2h
        title   = Good use of CdT
        comment = This test will be a bonus. Just try to do the best !
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Let's explain how this code works.

        1) ``date`` is for two informations. First we indicate when a test
        occurs or when a homework must be given back. Then we can indicate
        inside braces the day we give the information about the test to the
        students.

        In our example, we show the two formats allowed for dates : you can
        use either ``DD/MM/YYYY`` or ``YYYY-MM-DD`` where the numbers YYYY,
        MM and DD are respectively the year, the month and the day.

        If your CdT logs are set for one year, that is for twelve months,
        the year can be omitted.

        2) ``toc`` allows to indicate references to your lesson. Here
        ``A...B-I-1 & C-I`` indicates to learn from the chapter/part A to the
        subsection 1 in section I of the chapter/part B, and also to learn the
        section I of the chapter/part C.

        3) ``time`` is the duration of the test using standard notations.
        You can type ``120min`` instead of ``2h``.

        4) ``title`` is the title of the test.

        5) ``comment`` allows to add small comments about the test.
